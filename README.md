Make me big (pleeeeeeaaassssseeeee)
==========
It's an UX experiment, where a text changes size when you move back and forth in front of the screen.

👩🏼‍💻 Problem I solved ]{ WHY?
-------------------
I got the problem in real life. Once, I was late for work. And before leaving home I had to complete some tasks: iron the clothes and finish reading an article about work topic. I put a laptop near an ironing board and read while I was ironing my clothes. It was hard a bit to read the text, because of small font.
<br>

🦐 Possible solutions for my problem
-------
* Prepare earlier and always be in time (but what to do if something went wrong?).
* Don't read. Listen to information while you are getting ready for presentation/work.
* Change font-size in dev tools.
* Zoom the page.
* Just don't read.
* Read everything you need while you are going for a work.
<br>

💫 My solution
------------------
Solutios above are pretty adequate. But, as a human who loves experiments with AI and design, my solution is changing font-size automatically depending on your position in front of the screen.


**Cool possible upgrate for this experiment** <br>
Scrolling a page with a hand gesture, because now it's static and it's not handy to scroll the page if you move back from the screen.
<br>

👾 Code
----------------------
I tried to write readable code, so I added a lot of comments that tell what is happening in every function and not function.
* `public/posenet.js` is a file where project's logic lives. We work and talk with AI here.
* `views/index.html` is an HTML page, where we connect with p5.js and ml5.js.
* `public/style.css` is an CSS file... yes. You can notice that `@font-face` is on the first line, it's important to be in the beggining if you are working with a custom font.

**We use:**
* `TensorFlow.js PoseNet model` to detect your amazing eyes (also, other parts, if you want).
* `p5.js` to work with canvas and camera easy.
* `ml5.js` to work with simple syntax and connect with TensorFlow.js easy.

🃏🀄️ Font
---------
I used a great font — `Grafier` by [Alex  Slobzheninov](https://www.behance.net/slobzheninov). You can get to know about this font [on Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/75437393/Grafier-Serif-Typeface-Free-Fonts-Variable-Font). This font is free for personal non commercial projects (read the license). 
Font files are in `assets`.

🔮 My other experiments
-------
* [Mood + AI + Design](https://glitch.com/~mood-ai-design) where design is changed based on your emotions. Used: `face-api.js`.
* [Smile and like](https://glitch.com/~smile-and-like) where you smile and like posts on a fictional social media, haha. Used: `face-api.js`, `EJS`.
